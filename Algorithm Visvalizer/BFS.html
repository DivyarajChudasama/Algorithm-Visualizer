    <p style="font-size:20px;"><br><br>Breadth first search is a graph traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from the root node
        and explores all the neighbouring nodes.<br>Then it selects the nearest node and explores all the unexplored  nodes It is a recursive algorithm to search all vertices of a tree <br> <br><h1>Application:</h1></p><p style="font-size:20px;"> * BFS can be used to find the neighbouring locations from a given source location.<br>* 
    In a peer to peer network, BFS algorithm can be used as a traversal method to find all the neighbouring nodes.Most torrenrt clients, such as<br> BitTorrent Utorrent,etc. employ this process top find 
    "seeds" and "peers" in the network.<br>* BFS can be used in web crawlers to create web page indexes. It is one of the main algorithms that can be used to index web pages.It starts<br> traversing from the sourcepage and follows the links associated with the page.Here every page is considered as a node in the graph.<br>
    * BFS is used to determine the shortest path and  minimum spanning tree.<br>
    * BFS is also used in Cheney's technique to duplicate the garabage collection.<br>
    * It can be used in ford-Fulkerson method to compute the maximum flow in a flow network.</p>
