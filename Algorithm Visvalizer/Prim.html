    <p style="font-size:22px;"><br>Primâ€™s algorithm always starts with a single node and it moves through several adjacent nodes, in order to
        explore<br> all of the connected edges along the way.It starts with an empty spanning tree. The idea is to maintain two sets of<br> vertices.
         The first set contains the vertices already included in the MST, the other set contains the vertices not yet<br> included. At every step, it
          considers all the edges that connect the two sets and picks the minimum weight edge<br> from these edges. After picking the edge, it moves 
          the other endpoint of the edge to the set containing MST.
        <h1>Applications</h1>
        <p style="font-size:22px;">* Network for roads and Rail tracks connecting all the cities.
            <br>* Irrigation channels and placing microwave towers.
            <br>* Travelling Salesman Problem.
            <br>* Pathfinding algorithms used in AI(Artificial Intelligence).
            <br>* Cognitive Science.
